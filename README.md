# Python Testing (More specificially Unittest) Notes

#### Red-Green-Refactor:
* Test-driven development is a software  development process which relies on requirements being converted to test cases before the code is written
* Red - Write a test that fails - no code written yet
* Green - The test is passed - code is written in order to pass
* Refactor - Update code so it is more efficient and passes the test

#### Terms:
* A test case is a single test which test a particular thing. 
* A test suite is a grouping of test cases into a set of tests that belong together.
* A test fixture is used to ensure that there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. E.g. Loading a DB with a known set of data
